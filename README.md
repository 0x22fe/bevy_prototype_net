# Simple Networking for Bevy (Prototype)
## `bevy_prototype_simple_net`
This crate provides basic network functionality for the Bevy engine. While it is in a prototype stage, it is relatively easy to use and has been tested to work well.

It currently implements a **TCP-based client and server** as well as a **UDP-based client and server**.

To see it in action, visit the [examples](./examples/README.md) and run an example (eg. `cargo run --example net_server`).
